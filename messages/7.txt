Thanks for supporting Github Issue!

I add two features in this release:

- protect issue header area when writing issues.

- add a unified command "post_or_update_issue" and a unified shortcut "super+s" to post AND update issues.



Version 2.2.0 is quite mature and stable, it includes all features that github-issue.vim has. Special thanks for the testing works and useful suggestions from @Kristinita !
