Full label support! Again, please restart sublime Text to avoid possible errors.

you can add label simply by writing label's name in the corresponding line, if you want to add mutiple labels, just splits them with `,`

If a label is new, it will first create the label and add it to the issue. If a label exists already, it will be added directly.

for example:

# Title         : test
## Number       : 1
## State        : open
## Label        : new label, label1, label2
## Locked       : False
## Assignee     : None
